```whoami``` Sapiens Malti, Ph.D.

```whatis sapi.dev``` Yet another place where I share updates and musings. Now with added sovereignty.  

```tail -n 10 $PATH``` My love of Science led me to pursue a doctorate in technology (it says EE on the degree, but my [home research group is very interdisciplinary, and can best be described as a materials science and applied physics group](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/itn/loe)). After a post-doctoral stint at the [Fibre and Polymer Technology department](https://www.kth.se/fpt/fibre-and-polymer-technology-1.778696) at the [Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), I'm pretty pleased with [my modest contribution to the scientific and academic world](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=iezRpm0AAAAJ&hl=en). Another legacy is that I got to hang a Raymond quote in the halls of a wet chemistry lab (viz. ["Alchemists turned into chemists when they stopped keeping secrets."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar)). Reading the [hacker's how-to](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) as a kid had a profound influence on my worldview and personal vision. So, when I was offered the opportunity to help keep the internet open by team at [Apify Technologies](https://apify.com), I jumped on it and moved to the most beautiful city in the world (that's been run by the Pirate Party for the last 4 years)! I still can't formulate the elusive force that makes information seem embued with a drive to be free (as in speech, not beer), but the journey's certainly worthwhile.
