    <p><code>whoami</code> Sapiens Malti, Ph.D.</p>
<p><code>whatis sapi.dev</code> Yet another place where I share updates and musings. Now with added sovereignty.</p>
<p><code>tail -n 10 $PATH</code> My love of Science led me to pursue a doctorate in technology (it says EE on the degree, but my <a href="https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/itn/loe">home research group is very interdisciplinary, and can best be described as a materials science and applied physics group</a>). After a post-doctoral stint at the <a href="https://www.kth.se/fpt/fibre-and-polymer-technology-1.778696">Fibre and Polymer Technology department</a> at the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">Royal Institute of Technology</a>, I'm pretty pleased with <a href="https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=iezRpm0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">my modest contribution to the scientific and academic world</a>. Another legacy is that I got to hang a Raymond quote in the halls of a wet chemistry lab (viz. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">&quot;Alchemists turned into chemists when they stopped keeping secrets.&quot;</a>). Reading the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">hacker's how-to</a> as a kid had a profound influence on my worldview and personal vision. So, when I was offered the opportunity to help keep the internet open by team at <a href="https://apify.com">Apify Technologies</a>, I jumped on it and moved to the most beautiful city in the world (that's been run by the Pirate Party for the last 4 years)! I still can't formulate the elusive force that makes information seem embued with a drive to be free (as in speech, not beer), but the journey's certainly worthwhile.</p>
